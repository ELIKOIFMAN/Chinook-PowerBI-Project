#ÔøΩ Chinook Digital Media ‚Äî Power BI Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project simulates a digital media company, analyzing customer behavior, revenue performance, and genre demand across regions. 
The dataset is modeled using a star schema and analyzed in **Power BI** using DAX.

The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decisions like:
- Prioritizing content investment.
- Expanding into high-revenue markets.
- Understanding shifts in customer demand troughout the years.

---

## Business Questions
-  Which regions generate the most revenue?
-  Is revenue growing or declining over time?
-  Which genres are most in demand?
-  Are we providing enough content to meet that demand?

---

## Key Insights
- **USA** is the most profitable market but saw a revenue drop in 2025.
- **Germany**'s revenue fell sharply ‚Äî tied to missing genre variety.
- **Rock, Latin, Metal** are high-demand genres but underrepresented.
- Revenue drop is not due to lost interest, but lack of content availability.

---

## Strategic Recommendations
- Expand track offerings in high-demand genres (Rock, Latin, Metal)
- Reinvest in declining regions (Germany, USA) through promotions
- Run an A/B test to validate content expansion impact
- Implement personalization based on user preferences
